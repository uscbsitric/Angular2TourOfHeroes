  <!--
    The routerLink is the selector for the RouterLink directive that turns user clicks into router navigations. 
    It's another of the public directives in the RouterModule. 
  -->
  <a routerLink="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
  <a routerLink="/heroes">Heroes</a>
</nav>

<!--
  You removed <app-heroes> because you will only display the HeroesComponent when the user navigates to it.
  The <router-outlet> tells the router where to display routed views.
  The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the AppComponent because AppModule 
  imports AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule.

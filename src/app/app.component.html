<!--
  You removed <app-heroes> because you will only display the HeroesComponent when the user navigates to it.
  The <router-outlet> tells the router where to display routed views.
  The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the AppComponent because AppModule imports AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule.
